**All funding will be used to support orphans in SOS Children's Villages.**

*Many children are growing up without the care, protection and guidance they need.*
*SOS Children's Villages is there, working with children, young people and families to tackle this global issue on a local level.*
  
*We work to keep families (in where we called a village) together, provide alternative care when needed, support young people on their path to independence, and advocate for the rights of children. Together with donors, partners, communities and governments, we lay the foundations for a brighter future.*
